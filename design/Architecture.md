### 1.- Introduction

This document is the living **Architecture Specification** for **La Toscana**, a point-of-sale and franchise-management system designed for a chain of five coffee-shop branches located in Iztapalapa, Chalco, Amecameca, Yecapixtla and Cuautla, Mexico. The system was designed following the **Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) 3.0** process, which produces the architecture through a series of structured iterations, each one refining a subset of the system driven by a prioritized set of architectural drivers.

The main business motivation is to eliminate the estimated **$33,000–$58,000 MXN/month** in losses caused by unregistered orders, manual cash-register errors, inventory waste, and lack of centralized visibility for the owner. Three of the five branches have intermittent internet connectivity, which makes **offline-first operation** a hard constraint rather than a nice-to-have feature.

This document consolidates the outputs of all completed ADD iterations:

### 2.- Context diagram

This diagram shows the **system boundary** of the La Toscana system and all external actors that interact with it. There are two distinct deployment contexts: the **Branch Node** (one per branch, running on the existing branch PC on the local LAN) and the **Cloud Sync Hub** (a cloud-hosted service for cross-branch data aggregation and owner reporting). Actors access only the context that corresponds to their role: branch staff interact exclusively with the Branch Node over the local network, the owner accesses the Cloud Sync Hub over the internet, and the Sync Worker is an internal background process that bridges both contexts.

    owner -- "HTTPS (internet)" --> reportingAPI
    syncWorker -- "HTTPS POST /sync" --> syncAPI
    customer -. "HTTPS (QR menu, future)" .-> mpa
```

> **Actor access rules:** Branch staff and kitchen displays interact exclusively with the Branch Node over the local LAN — they have no direct access to the Cloud Sync Hub. The owner accesses only the Reporting API on the Cloud Sync Hub over the internet. The Sync Worker is an internal actor; it has no user-facing interface.

#### 3.4 — Architectural Concerns (selected high-priority)

| ID | Concern |
|---|---|
| C001.2.1 | Offline-online synchronization strategy: ensure data consistency when branches operate with intermittent connectivity and multiple devices generate simultaneous data. |
| C001.2.2 | Local data persistence: define where and how data is stored on each device while operating offline. |
| C002.1.1 | Inter-module integration: define an internal architecture with cohesive modules and low coupling. |
| C002.1.2 | Cross-module atomicity: guarantee consistency between sale recording and inventory deduction, especially offline. |
| C002.1.3 | User-story dependencies: manage technical dependencies between stories based on data or prior capabilities. |
| C003.1.1 | RBAC implementation: design robust authentication and authorization for differentiated roles without operational friction. |
| C003.1.2 | Permission granularity: define the permission matrix per role. |
| C003.1.3 | Session management: define expiration, auto-logout, and concurrency on shared devices. |
| C003.1.4 | Offline authentication: define how identity is validated without a connection to the central hub. |
| C003.3.1 | Full operation traceability: record who performed which action and when for orders, payments, inventory, and cash cuts. |
| C004.3.1 | Operational continuity on central server failure: branches must keep operating critical functions. |
| C005.1.1 | Module boundaries: delimit responsibilities for each module to enable parallel development. |
| C006.1.3 | Offline UX: communicate connectivity status, errors, and pending sync items to the staff. |
| C007.1.1 | Multi-branch data structure: support multiple branches, concurrent users, and daily order volume without degradation. |
| C007.1.2 | Isolation vs. shared data: define which data is shared and which is branch-scoped. |
### 4.- Domain model

This domain model captures the core business concepts of the **La Toscana** franchise management system.
It is derived from the functional requirements (HU-01 to HU-28), the quality attribute scenarios and the architectural constraints defined in `ArchitecturalDrivers.md`.
The model is organized around seven bounded contexts: **Identity & Access**, **Order Management**, **Product Catalog**, **Inventory**, **Financial Operations**, **Purchasing**, and **Reporting**.

| **PurchaseOrderLine** | Value Object | One line (ingredient, quantity ordered, quantity received, unit cost) within a `PurchaseOrder`. |
| **Customer** | Entity | Stores basic contact data for a guest to support future loyalty programs (HU-26, NEC-09). |
| **SyncQueue** | Entity | Queues entity mutations generated while a branch is offline, to be replayed upon reconnection (HU-27, RES-01, RES-07, C001.2.1). |
| **SyncStatus** | Enumeration | Lifecycle of a queued item: PENDING → SYNCED / CONFLICT / FAILED. |
| **AuditLog** | Entity | Immutable record of every sensitive action (who, what, when) for security traceability (QA-SEC-02, C003.3.1, C003.3.2). |



### 5.- Container diagram

This diagram shows the top-level containers that compose the La Toscana system as established in Iteration 1. There are five autonomous **Branch Nodes** (one per branch), each running on the existing branch PC, and one central **Cloud Sync Hub** hosted in the cloud. Each Branch Node is fully self-contained and operational without internet access. The Cloud Sync Hub aggregates data from all branches and exposes a reporting interface exclusively to the owner.

```

> **Actor separation:** Staff browsers (waiters, cashiers, managers, baristas, cooks) access **only** the Branch Node MPA via local LAN — no direct access to the Cloud Sync Hub. The owner browser accesses **only** the Reporting API on the Cloud Sync Hub over the internet. Customers/diners are out of scope for this iteration (QR menu is addressed in Iteration 6).

> **Sync Worker colocation:** The Sync Worker is a background OS-level process (daemon/service) running on the **same physical branch PC** as the Branch Application Server and PostgreSQL. It is not a separate machine. It has no HTTP interface; it only reads from the local DB and pushes to the Cloud Sync Hub.

#### Container responsibilities

| Container | Who accesses it | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **MPA Web Frontend** | Staff browsers — local LAN only | Serves server-rendered HTML pages to staff browsers on branch PCs and tablets. Provides role-gated sections: POS View, Kitchen Display View, Manager View. Calls the Branch Application Server in-process. |
| **Branch Application Server** | MPA Web Frontend (in-process) | Hosts the modular monolith with all branch-local business logic (Identity & Access, Order Management, Product Catalog, Inventory, Financial Operations). Each module accessed only through its Public API/Facade. |
| **Local PostgreSQL DB** | Branch App Server (SQL); Sync Worker (reads sync schema) | Persists all branch-local data using one schema per bounded-context module plus a shared `sync` schema for the SyncQueue outbox. Provides ACID guarantees for financial data integrity. |
| **Sync Worker** | Local DB (reads); Cloud Sync Hub (writes) | Background process collocated on the branch PC. Reads `PENDING` entries from `sync.sync_queue` and pushes them to the Cloud Sync Hub when internet is available. Marks entries `SYNCED`, `CONFLICT`, or `FAILED`. |
| **Sync API** | Sync Workers from all 5 branches | REST write endpoint on the Cloud Sync Hub. Receives sync payloads, applies them to the Central DB, returns conflict markers. |
| **Reporting API** | Owner browser — internet only | Read-only REST endpoint on the Cloud Sync Hub. Serves consolidated multi-branch data (sales, inventory, financials) exclusively to the owner. |
| **Central PostgreSQL DB** | Sync API (writes); Reporting API (reads) | Consolidated database at hub level. Stores data synced from all five branches. Source of truth for cross-branch reporting. |

### 6.- Component diagrams

#### 6.1 — Branch Application Server

This diagram details the internal architecture of the Branch Application Server (a modular monolith). The **Presentation Layer** (Auth Middleware + POS Controllers) is the sole entry point. It delegates to the five bounded-context modules exclusively through each module's **«facade layer» (Public API)**. 

Inside each module, the **«application layer»** orchestrates use cases without touching the database directly. Only the **«infrastructure layer»** (Repositories) has access to the PostgreSQL databases. Cross-module database joins are forbidden.

#### Component responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **RoleBasedAccessControlFilter (Auth Middleware)** | Intercepts HTTP requests application-wide. Validates session JWT via `IdentityPublicAPI`, checks the `identity.permissions` table, and attaches the `User` to the context. Throws 403 Forbidden if the user's role lacks access. |
| **ConnectivityService** | Exposes a lightweight `/api/health` ping endpoint used by the MPA Web Frontend to display the global Sync Status Indicator (Ping/Echo tactic). |
| **WaiterPOSController** | HTTP entry point for waiters (`GET /orders/new`, `POST /orders`, etc.). Validates waiter RBAC role on the context user. Delegates to `OrderManagementAPI` to create/edit orders and renders the response. |
| **CashierPOSController** | HTTP entry point for cashiers. Two-step payment form. Validates cashier RBAC role. Delegates order reads to `OrderManagementAPI` and sale execution to `FinancialOperationsAPI`. |
| **Identity & Access Module (SessionManager)** | Handles login/logout and session validation. Caches hashed passwords, roles, and permissions locally so branches can operate fully offline. |
| **Order Management Module** | Enforces the `Order` Aggregate Root state machine (OPEN-only edits). Records `AuditLog` on mutation. Snapshots catalog prices. Generates `SyncQueue` outbox records. Exposes internal `markAsClosed` operation for shared-transaction execution. |
| **Product Catalog Module** | Read-only in this iteration. Exposes operations to retrieve available products and lookup product details (prices). |
| **Financial Operations Module** | Executes `closeSale` inside a single PostgreSQL transaction (Unit of Work) spanning local Financial and Order updates. Records `paymentMethod` (CASH/CARD) locally without external gateway calls. Generates `SyncQueue` outbox records. |
| **Inventory Module** | Public API to be detailed in Iteration 4. Tracks ingredient stock levels per branch and generates low-stock alerts. |
| **sync.sync_queue (Outbox)** | Shared DB table written by module Infrastructure layers. Stores PENDING entity mutations to be picked up by the background Sync Worker. Guarantees zero data loss (offline-first). |
| **audit.audit_log** | Append-only DB table written by module Infrastructure layers. Immutable record of who performed which sensitive action and when. |

### 7.- Sequence diagrams

#### 7.1 — Offline Write and Synchronization Flow

This diagram illustrates the cross-cutting offline-first pattern: a branch operation (e.g., order creation) is written locally first and stored in the SyncQueue outbox. When the Sync Worker detects internet connectivity, it pushes pending entries to the Cloud Sync Hub. This flow satisfies **C001.2.1** (offline-online sync strategy), **QA-REL-01** (0% data loss after offline period), and **QA-REL-03** (consistent global state after multi-branch reconnection).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant AppServer as Branch App Server
    participant LocalDB as Local PostgreSQL
    participant SyncWorker as Sync Worker
    participant CloudHub as Cloud Sync Hub

    Browser->>AppServer: POST /orders (create order)
    AppServer->>LocalDB: INSERT INTO orders.orders (...)
    AppServer->>LocalDB: INSERT INTO sync.sync_queue (entity_type='order', status='PENDING')
    AppServer-->>Browser: 201 Created

    Note over SyncWorker: Polls periodically, detects connectivity
    SyncWorker->>LocalDB: SELECT * FROM sync.sync_queue WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'RETRY')
    LocalDB-->>SyncWorker: [pending entries batch]
    SyncWorker->>CloudHub: POST /sync (payload with entity data and version)
    
    alt Central DB accepts (No conflict)
        CloudHub-->>SyncWorker: 200 OK
        SyncWorker->>LocalDB: UPDATE sync_queue SET status = 'SYNCED'
    else Central DB version mismatch (LWW Strategy)
        CloudHub-->>SyncWorker: 409 Conflict (Conflict Markers)
        SyncWorker->>LocalDB: UPDATE sync_queue SET status = 'CONFLICT'
        Note over SyncWorker: Conflict resolution deferred to manual audit / hub logic
    else Network Failure
        SyncWorker->>LocalDB: UPDATE sync_queue SET retry_count += 1
        Note over SyncWorker: Exponential backoff triggered
    end
```

#### 7.2 — Offline Authentication and RBAC Flow (HU-27, HU-28)

This diagram illustrates how staff can authenticate and pass security checks even if the Cloud Hub is utterly unreachable, relying entirely on the local Branch Database.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User as Staff Browser
    participant AuthMW as RoleBasedAccessControlFilter
    participant IdAPI as IdentityPublicAPI
    participant SessionMgr as SessionManager
    participant DB as Local PostgreSQL
    participant Controller as (e.g.) CashierPOSController

    Note over User,DB: Branch internet goes down
    
    User->>AuthMW: POST /login {user, pass}
    AuthMW->>SessionMgr: issueJWT(user, pass)
    SessionMgr->>DB: SELECT passwordHash, role FROM identity.users WHERE username=?
    DB-->>SessionMgr: hash, 'CASHIER'
    SessionMgr->>SessionMgr: match passwordHash
    SessionMgr-->>AuthMW: return JWT
    AuthMW-->>User: Set-Cookie: JWT

    User->>AuthMW: POST /cashier/orders/123/pay
    AuthMW->>SessionMgr: validateSession(JWT)
    SessionMgr->>SessionMgr: decode JWT -> role='CASHIER'
    SessionMgr->>DB: SELECT action FROM identity.permissions WHERE role='CASHIER' AND resource='/cashier/orders/'
    DB-->>SessionMgr: 'POST' (Permission Granted)
    SessionMgr-->>AuthMW: User Context
    AuthMW->>Controller: Forward Request with User Context
    Controller-->>User: 200 OK (Payment Processed Offline)
```

#### 7.3 — Waiter Registers an Order (HU-01, HU-06)

This diagram illustrates how a waiter creates a new order and adds product lines, showing the interaction between the Presentation Layer, Identity, Order Management, and the Product Catalog.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Waiter as Waiter Browser
    participant WCtrl as WaiterPOSController
    participant IdAPI as IdentityPublicAPI
    participant OSvc as OrderApplicationService
    participant CatAPI as CatalogPublicAPI
    participant DB as Local PostgreSQL

    Waiter->>WCtrl: POST /orders {tableId, orderType=DINE_IN}
    WCtrl->>IdAPI: validateSession(token) → User{id, role=WAITER}
    WCtrl->>OSvc: createOrder(waiterId, tableId, DINE_IN)
    OSvc->>DB: INSERT orders.orders (id, status=OPEN, version=0, ...)
    OSvc->>DB: INSERT audit.audit_log (action=ORDER_CREATED)
    OSvc-->>WCtrl: OrderDTO{id, status=OPEN}
    WCtrl-->>Waiter: Redirect → GET /orders/{id}

    Waiter->>WCtrl: POST /orders/{id}/lines {productId, quantity=2}
    WCtrl->>IdAPI: validateSession(token) → User{id, role=WAITER}
    WCtrl->>OSvc: addLine(orderId, productId, qty=2)
    OSvc->>CatAPI: getProductById(productId) → Product{price}
    OSvc->>OSvc: order.addLine(product, qty) [Aggregate enforces OPEN state]
    OSvc->>DB: INSERT orders.order_lines (orderId, productId, qty, unitPrice)
    OSvc->>DB: UPDATE orders.orders SET version=1 WHERE id=? AND version=0
    OSvc->>DB: INSERT audit.audit_log (action=LINE_ADDED)
    OSvc-->>WCtrl: OrderLineDTO
    WCtrl-->>Waiter: 200 OK — updated order view
```

#### 7.4 — Cashier Views Order and Closes Sale (HU-04, HU-05)

This diagram outlines the two-step cashier flow: reviewing the auto-calculated total, then executing the payment within a single cross-schema database transaction.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Cashier as Cashier Browser
    participant CCtrl as CashierPOSController
    participant IdAPI as IdentityPublicAPI
    participant OSvc as OrderApplicationService
    participant SSvc as SaleApplicationService
    participant DB as Local PostgreSQL

    Note over Cashier,DB: Step 1 — View order total (HU-04)
    Cashier->>CCtrl: GET /cashier/orders/{id}/pay
    CCtrl->>IdAPI: validateSession(token) → User{id, role=CASHIER}
    CCtrl->>OSvc: getOrderWithTotal(orderId) → OrderDetailDTO{total, lines, status}
    CCtrl-->>Cashier: Render payment form (method selector + total)

    Note over Cashier,DB: Step 2 — Confirm payment (HU-05)
    Cashier->>CCtrl: POST /cashier/orders/{id}/pay {paymentMethod=CASH}
    CCtrl->>IdAPI: validateSession(token) → User{id, role=CASHIER}
    CCtrl->>SSvc: closeSale(orderId, CASH, cashierId, terminalRef?)

    Note over SSvc,DB: BEGIN TRANSACTION (shared DB connection)
    SSvc->>OSvc: getOrderForPayment(orderId) → OrderPaymentDTO{total, version=N}
    SSvc->>OSvc: markAsClosed(orderId, expectedVersion=N, txCtx)
    OSvc->>DB: UPDATE orders.orders SET status=CLOSED, version=N+1 WHERE id=? AND version=N
    Note over DB: 0 rows → ConcurrentModificationException (Optimistic Lock)
    SSvc->>DB: INSERT financial.sales (orderId, total, paymentMethod, closedAt)
    SSvc->>DB: INSERT financial.receipts (saleId, content, issuedAt)
    SSvc->>DB: INSERT audit.audit_log (action=SALE_CLOSED)
    Note over SSvc,DB: COMMIT

    SSvc-->>CCtrl: SaleDTO{id, total, receiptId}
    CCtrl-->>Cashier: Redirect → receipt view
```

### 8.- Interfaces

This section documents the **public API contracts** for every module facade defined through Iteration 3. These are the only legally callable boundaries between modules inside the Branch Application Server; no caller may access internal layers (Application, Domain, or Repository) directly.

#### 8.1 — IdentityPublicAPI (Identity & Access Module)

| Operation | Signature | Description | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issueJWT` | `issueJWT(username: String, password: String) → JWT` | Validates credentials against locally cached `identity.users` (bcrypt hash comparison). Issues a signed JWT with embedded role and expiry. Fully offline-capable. | `RoleBasedAccessControlFilter` (login flow) |
| `validateSession` | `validateSession(token: JWT) → UserContext` | Verifies the JWT signature and expiry. Decodes the role claim and queries `identity.permissions` to build the `UserContext{id, role, permissions}`. Fully offline-capable. | `RoleBasedAccessControlFilter` (per-request) |

> **Error codes:** `401 Unauthorized` — invalid credentials or expired token. `403 Forbidden` — valid session but role lacks the required permission on the requested resource/action.

---

#### 8.2 — OrderManagementAPI (Order Management Module)

| Operation | Signature | Description | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `createOrder` | `createOrder(waiterId: UUID, tableId: UUID?, type: OrderType) → OrderDTO` | Creates a new `Order` in `OPEN` state. Writes an `AuditLog` entry and a `SyncQueue` outbox record. | `WaiterPOSController` |
| `addLine` | `addLine(orderId: UUID, productId: UUID, qty: int) → OrderLineDTO` | Appends a line to an OPEN order. Snapshots the current price via `CatalogPublicAPI`. Enforces optimistic lock (`version`). Writes `AuditLog`. | `WaiterPOSController` |
| `removeLine` | `removeLine(orderId: UUID, lineId: UUID) → void` | Removes a line from an OPEN order. Enforces OPEN-only guard. Writes `AuditLog`. | `WaiterPOSController` |
| `cancelOrder` | `cancelOrder(orderId: UUID, actorId: UUID) → void` | Transitions order to `CANCELLED`. Requires OPEN state. Writes `AuditLog`. | `WaiterPOSController`, `CashierPOSController` |
| `getActiveOrders` | `getActiveOrders(sucursalId: UUID) → List<OrderSummaryDTO>` | Returns all non-closed, non-cancelled orders for the branch (for cashier and kitchen views). | `CashierPOSController` |
| `getOrderWithTotal` | `getOrderWithTotal(orderId: UUID) → OrderDetailDTO` | Returns the full order detail including auto-calculated total. | `CashierPOSController` |
| `getOrderForPayment` | `getOrderForPayment(orderId: UUID) → OrderPaymentDTO` | Returns the order's current total and `version` for the payment transaction. Called inside a shared DB transaction. | `SaleApplicationService` |
| `markAsClosed` | `markAsClosed(orderId: UUID, expectedVersion: int, txCtx: TxContext) → void` | Transitions order to `CLOSED` using optimistic lock (WHERE version = expectedVersion). **Must be called within an active transaction context.** Throws `ConcurrentModificationException` on version mismatch. | `SaleApplicationService` |

> **Invariants:** All write operations reject calls on orders not in `OPEN` state with `422 Unprocessable Entity`.

---

#### 8.3 — CatalogPublicAPI (Product Catalog Module)

| Operation | Signature | Description | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getAvailableProducts` | `getAvailableProducts(sucursalId: UUID) → List<ProductSummaryDTO>` | Returns all currently available products for display in the order-taking UI. Read-only, no side effects. | `WaiterPOSController` |
| `getProductById` | `getProductById(productId: UUID) → ProductDTO` | Returns full product details including current price. Used for price snapshotting when adding order lines. | `OrderApplicationService` |

---

#### 8.4 — FinancialOperationsAPI (Financial Operations Module)

| Operation | Signature | Description | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `closeSale` | `closeSale(orderId: UUID, paymentMethod: PaymentMethod, cashierId: UUID, terminalRef?: String) → SaleDTO` | Executes the complete sale-close flow inside a single PostgreSQL transaction spanning `orders` and `financial` schemas: marks order CLOSED, inserts `Sale`, inserts `Receipt`, writes `AuditLog` and `SyncQueue` outbox records. No external payment gateway is called. | `CashierPOSController` |
| `getSalesByDate` | `getSalesByDate(sucursalId: UUID, date: LocalDate) → List<SaleSummaryDTO>` | Returns all sales for a given branch and date. Used for the daily cash-register cut. | `CashierPOSController`, Branch Manager views |
| `getReceiptForSale` | `getReceiptForSale(saleId: UUID) → ReceiptDTO` | Returns the receipt content for a completed sale. | `CashierPOSController` |

---

#### 8.5 — ConnectivityService (Presentation Layer — read-only endpoint)

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/health` | `GET` | `{ online: Boolean, pending_syncs: int, conflicts: int }` | Lightweight ping endpoint polled by the MPA Web Frontend every 15 seconds. Reads the Sync Worker's last connectivity state and counts `PENDING`/`CONFLICT` rows in `sync.sync_queue`. Used to power the global Sync Status Indicator (C006.1.3). |

---

#### 8.6 — Sync API (Cloud Sync Hub — external boundary)

| Endpoint | Method | Request body | Response | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /sync` | `POST` | `SyncPayload { entityType, entityId, sucursalId, version, payload }` | `200 OK` / `409 Conflict { conflictMarkers }` | Receives batched outbox entries from Sync Workers. Applies them to the Central DB using Last-Write-Wins (LWW) version checking. Returns `409` with conflict markers if the incoming version is obsolete. |

#### 8.7 — InventoryPublicAPI (Inventory Module — deferred to Iteration 4)

The public API for the Inventory module is reserved and will be fully defined in Iteration 4. It will expose at minimum:
- `getStockLevel(ingredientId, sucursalId) → StockDTO`
- `adjustStock(inventoryItemId, quantity, reason, actorId) → void`
- `getActiveAlerts(sucursalId) → List<StockAlertDTO>`

### 9.- Design decisions

The following design decisions were made to address the selected drivers across iterations.

#### Iteration 1 Decisions (Baseline Architecture)
| Driver | Decision | Rationale | Discarded Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| RES-01, RES-09, QA-AVA-02, C004.3.1 | Deploy one self-contained **Branch Node** per branch running on the existing branch PC | Branches must operate fully offline. A local node eliminates internet dependency for day-to-day operations and runs on existing hardware without additional investment. | Pure Cloud SaaS *(inoperable without internet)*; Thin client to central server *(single point of failure)* |
| RES-01, QA-REL-01, QA-REL-03, C001.2.1 | **Offline-First + Outbox Pattern (SyncQueue)** — writes go to the local DB first; a Sync Worker replays them to the hub when connectivity is restored | Guarantees zero data loss during offline periods. Idempotent replay prevents duplicates on reconnection. Decouples write performance from network availability. | Fire-and-forget HTTP sync *(loses data on timeout)*; Polling without queue *(misses events during offline windows)* |
| RES-06, QA-SEC-01/02/03, C003.1.1, C003.1.4 | **RBAC with locally cached permission table** in the Auth Module | Six operational roles must be enforced even when the branch has no internet. A locally cached role/permission table enables offline authentication without contacting the Cloud Hub. | ABAC *(over-complex for team size)*; Online-only RBAC *(fails offline)* |
| RES-03, RES-09 | **Server-rendered Multi-Page Application (MPA)** instead of SPA | The Branch Application Server is always reachable on the local LAN. An MPA requires no client-side build toolchain, making it significantly simpler for MVP. | SPA *(unnecessary complexity)*; Native apps *(multiply maintenance cost)* |
| C001.2.2, C005.1.1 | **One PostgreSQL schema per bounded-context module** (`identity`, `orders`, `catalog`, `inventory`, `financial`, `sync`) within the single branch Local DB | Enforces data isolation at the DB level within a single DB instance. Modules cannot join across schemas; they must communicate through Application-layer Public APIs. | Separate DB instance per module *(operational overhead)*; Shared schema with prefixed tables *(no enforced isolation)* |
| C002.1.1, C005.1.1, QA-MOD-01 | Each module exposes a **«facade layer» / Public API** as its only external entry point; internal layers are private | Makes module boundaries explicit and enforceable. Prevents coupling between modules through internal classes or DB queries. | Direct cross-module calls into Application/Domain layers *(creates tight coupling)* |
| C007.1.1, C007.1.2 | **Cloud Sync Hub** with separate Sync API (write) and Reporting API (read) backed by a Central PostgreSQL DB | Separates sync traffic from reporting traffic. The hub is the authority node for cross-branch data aggregation. | Branch-to-branch sync *(no authority node, conflict resolution intractable)* |

#### Iteration 2 Decisions (Order & Financial Flows)
| Driver | Decision | Rationale | Discarded Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| HU-01, HU-04, HU-06, C002.1.3 | `OrderApplicationService` exposes named commands and queries as the sole Public API of Order Management | Named use-case methods enforce a single responsibility per operation. The dependency chain HU-01 → HU-04 → HU-05 is made explicit through `createOrder` → `getOrderWithTotal` → `closeSale`. | Mixed controller-business logic; transaction-script with no service boundary |
| HU-01, QA-SEC-02, C003.3.1 | `Order` class acts as Aggregate Root — enforces OPEN-only edits, owns the state machine | Invariants checked in one place without duplicating guards across callers. Closed orders are structurally unmodifiable. | Anemic model with checks in every controller; no explicit state machine |
| QA-REL-02 | `version INTEGER` column on `orders.orders` + `WHERE version = ?` guard in `OrderRepository.save` | Low-cost inclusion now avoids a cross-branch migration later. Satisfies QA-REL-02 with no DB-level lock held during user interaction. | Pessimistic locking (kills concurrency); no locking (deferred migration risk) |
| HU-05, C002.3.1 | `closeSale` records `paymentMethod` + optional `terminalRef` locally; no external API call | Physical bank terminal handles card authorization independently. Branch remains fully offline-capable (RES-01). | External payment gateway API (requires internet); Stripe Terminal SDK (incompatible with offline-first) |
| C002.1.2 | `closeSale` spans `orders` and `financial` schemas in a single PostgreSQL transaction | Atomicity within the single-process modular monolith guarantees either both the order close and the sale record commit, or neither does. | Saga with compensating transactions (overkill); eventual consistency via Outbox (appropriate for cloud sync, not for immediate local POS close) |
| QA-SEC-02, C003.3.1 | `AuditLog` written by Infrastructure layer inside every Application Service command within the same transaction | Audit entries are inseparable from the operation that produced them — both commit or both roll back. No audit entry can be lost or forged. | Audit in Presentation Layer (misses non-browser calls); separate audit service (breaks atomicity) |
| QA-USA-03 | Two-step cashier payment flow: `GET /pay` renders the method selector; `POST /pay` confirms | Cashier can review and change the method before finalizing — correction in ≤ 2 steps with no data loss. | Single-step POST (no chance to correct); client-side modal (adds JS complexity to an MPA) |
| C002.1.3 | `OrderApplicationService.addLine` calls `CatalogPublicAPI.getProductById` to snapshot `unitPrice` into `OrderLine` | Price at order time is preserved even if the catalog is updated later. Prevents price drift on active orders. | Reading price at payment time (price drift risk); storing only productId (requires join at query time, cross-schema violation) |

#### Iteration 3 Decisions (Security & Offline Sync)
| Driver | Decision | Rationale | Discarded Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| RES-06, QA-SEC-01, C003.1.4 | **Authenticate Users & Authorize Access (Local Cache)**: Evaluate RBAC locally in the Branch Node | Permits 100% offline authentication (critical for RES-01) with ultra-fast checks. Meets all complex RBAC needs for the 6 roles without reaching the central hub. | Online-only Auth (e.g., Auth0, OAuth to Central Hub) *(Branch fails if internet drops)* |
| QA-REL-01, QA-REL-03, RES-07 | **Refined Outbox Pattern** with batching and exponential backoff | Enhances the SyncWorker daemon to prevent network flooding and handle extended outages gracefully. Zero data loss regardless of downtime length. | Direct POST with simple retry loop *(eats CPU/Network and fails under load after an outage)* |
| RES-07, QA-REL-01, QA-REL-03, C001.2.1 | **Idempotent Write + At-Least-Once Delivery** (`outbox_id` UUID + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on Hub) | Branches own strictly disjoint transactional datasets (orders, sales, inventory are branch-scoped). No two branches can write the same record, so LWW conflict resolution is inapplicable. The real reliability risk is Sync Worker retries creating duplicates in the Central DB on network timeouts. Idempotent Write eliminates this with zero additional coordination. | LWW *(solves a conflict problem that does not exist in this domain)*; Exactly-Once Delivery via 2PC *(requires distributed locks incompatible with offline-first operation)* |
| C006.1.3, QA-SEC-03 | **Ping/Echo (Connectivity Status Indicator)** on the frontend | Solves the usability requirement to keep staff informed of background network issues. A simple lightweight `/api/health` polling feeds visual cues (e.g., "Offline - 12 changes pending"). | Silent sync operations *(staff blinded to network failure, cannot anticipate reporting delays)* |
